# vu_app_project
VU App: a full-stack web-app, allowing a single user to track all the countries they've travelled to, as well as their favourite view-points from that country. 
Built using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, psycopg2.

Below is the main page of the user, with dropdown menus to select a country and whether or not they have visited already. When submitting, the country will be added to the appropriate list underneath. 

The stats at the top automatically update to show the percetage of the world the user has visited, and number of countries visited in total. 

The user can then click on any of the countries to enter that country's page.

Below is the page of a specific country where the user can add their favourite viewpoints along with some details about it. The viewpoints, as well as the countries themselves, can also be edited from here.
