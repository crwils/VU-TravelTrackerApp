Below is the main page, with dropdown menus to select a country and whether or not they have visited already. When submitting, the country will be added to the appropriate list underneath which uses CSS Flex to stay responsive.

The stats at the top automatically update to show the percetage of the world the user has visited, and number of countries visited in total. 

The user can then click on any of the countries to enter that country's page.
